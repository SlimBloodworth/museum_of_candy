## Overview

- A project to update myself with the current bootstrap (bootstrap 5.3 at this time).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

### Links

## My process

- This concept was an idea from Colt Steele. My process was to begin wit setting up my workflow, which was to link up the bootstrap CDN and JS links, the to set up the files and file links. I started with the Navbar, from there I gathered images and assets that I wanted to use in this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
